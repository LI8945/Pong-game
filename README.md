# Pong-game
This is a fun and simple recreation of the classic Pong arcade game built with Python’s Turtle graphics module. Two players can compete by controlling paddles on the left and right sides of the screen. The goal is to bounce the ball back and forth without missing it—first to make the other side miss scores a point!
